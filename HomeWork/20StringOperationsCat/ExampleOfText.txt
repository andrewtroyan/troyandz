In the meantime, a plainclothes policeman 
visited Mohamed's mother. He asked her about 
Mohamed and wanted to know why he didn't see 
the "unemployed graduate" group anymore. The 
poor woman answered as well as she could, with 
hesitation and apprehension. The policeman 
handed her a summons,according to which her son 
was to report to the police department that evening.
She started to cry, knowing that the police
never brought good news. She
thought it best to tell the officer, "My son
is not political." He left without replying.
